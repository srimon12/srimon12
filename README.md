### 🛠️ Top Skills & Technologies

**Backend & Infra:**  
FastAPI, Python, Docker, Postgres, Oracle Cloud (self-hosted, hardened)

**Edge-Native:**  
Cloudflare Workers (Durable Objects, KV, D1, Pub/Sub), custom IAM stacks

**AI & Data:**  
RAG (Qdrant, fastembed, hybrid BM25+dense), agent orchestration (LangGraph, MCP), eval+patch feedback loops

**Frontend:**  
React, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, TanStack

**Security:**  
EdDSA JWTs, session/device binding, RBAC, revocation flows, threat modeling

### 🚀 Favorite Projects

#### [MyKB](https://github.com/veristamp/myKB)
_On-prem AI Knowledge Base_  
Secure ingestion of code + docs, hybrid retrieval (Qdrant), IAM enforcement at the query layer. Designed for enterprises to run AI locally—**zero data egress**.

#### [VeriStamp](https://github.com/veristamp/VIA)
_Proof & Integrity Layer_  
Edge-native cryptographic stamping (client-side hashing + EdDSA). Passkeys by default, revocation & rotation built-in.

#### [VIA (VeriStamp Incident Atlas)](https://github.com/veristamp/VIA)
_Qdrant-powered anomaly clustering_  
Detects incident rhythms, correlates causality in real-time logs.

#### ReLo / DealTracker Lineage
Practical full-stack blueprints—hardened FastAPI backends, React admin dashboards, refresh-token security models.

### 🏆 Notable Achievements

- **Resurrected a dead university lab:**  
  Revived vacuum systems & annealing furnaces, synthesized Barium Titanate overnight, validated by senior researchers—**saved ₹7.8 lakhs in AMC.**
- **Solo-built & shipped distributed systems:**  
  From zero to production in days/weeks, without teams or budgets.
- **Operated and retired a complex affiliate network:**  
  Lessons distilled into a design ethos: “consequences by design.”
